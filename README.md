#MungeGen

Munge some random sounds together, make a silly word. Visit the [Github pages URL](http://cemrajc.github.io/mungegen) to use it, or run it yourself for offline/personal use.


### How to run it yourself

You have two options:

1. Download the source code as a zip and run the index.html file with your favourite (or most hated) web-browser
2. Get the source code and run a local (or public) server to serve them static. It should work without too much help.

### Why does this even exist?!

Well, I was bored once and decided that the way syllables meld together in a pronounceable way was actually interesting. This is the result of my curiosity - it's not perfect, but it works.

Enjoy :P<br>
